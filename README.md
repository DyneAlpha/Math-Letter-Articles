# Math-Letter-Articles
These PDF files are articles of "Math Letter", a bi-monthly mathematics magazine.
I have contributed these articles in order to help students study general topology, as I think that topology is the foundation of mathematics used both in analysis and geometry.
As they are written in Korean language, I'll add a brief summary of their contents:

Separation Axioms and Spaces I: Separation of Points by Neighborhoods
Definition of T0,T1,T2,T2.5 spaces, implication relation between them, examples and counterexamples, filter characterization of T2 spaces

Separation Axioms and Spaces II: Separation of Sets by Neighborhoods
Definition of T3,T4,T5 spaces, implication relation between them, examples and counterexamples

Separation Axioms and Spaces III: Separation by Functions
Definition of Completely T2,T3.5,T6 spaces, implication relation between all separation spaces, Urysohn Lemma and Tietze Extension Theorem

Separation Axioms and Spaces IV: Applications of Separation Spaces
Heriditary properties (into subspaces and product spaces) of Separation Spaces, interaction between separation and countability axioms, metric topology and metrization

Invariance of Domain
Sperner's Lemma, (combinatorial proof of) Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, Invariance of Domain, Invariance of Manifold Boundary and Manifold Dimension

Filters and Nets
Definition of filters and nets, characterization of topological properties using filters and nets, equivalence between them, sequences as nets
